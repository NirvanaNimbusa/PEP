# PEP Samples

## Project status

PEP development ceased in 2018. A few minor maintenance patches have been pushed since then, and the latest version (0.5.3) has been published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pepjs). However, native support for Pointer Events is relatively good in most browsers at this point - see [caniuse: Pointer Events](https://caniuse.com/pointer). This project is now archived.

## Description

PEP is a polyfill for [Pointer Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents). Pointer Events provide a unified event system for the web platform.
